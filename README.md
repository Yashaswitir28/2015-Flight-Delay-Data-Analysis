# 2015-Flight-Delay-Data-Analysis

I recently dove into a fascinating dataset of over 5 million commercial airline flights from 2015. It's packed with details like airline names, flight numbers, where they took off and landed, how far they flew, and both their scheduled and actual departure and arrival times. To analyse this data I have used Power BI tool.

# Recommended Analysis
**Question 1: How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week?**

Answer: The dashboard includes a "Total Flights by DAY OF WEEK" bar chart, showing flight volume variation by day of the week. The second image shows part of a "Total Flights by Month name" bar chart, which would illustrate monthly variation. The total number of flights is stated as 6M (6 million).
